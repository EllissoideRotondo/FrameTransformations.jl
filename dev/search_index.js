Therefore, within the context of development \n        of Basic a (full) julia reader for JPL/INPOP ephemeris is foreseen. This package\n        is actually at the early stage of the development at the moment, thus any \n        contribution would be highly appreciated.\n\n        This is being performed in a separate package called `Ephemeris` within the JSMD\n        environment.\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">AD2</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">\n        <b>Caching</b>: if you have a deep look into the FrameSystem structure, you'll \n        see that some frames have a dedicated cache. This goes in contrast with the use \n        of ForwardDiff, since it would require a Dual's compatible cache: there is, then,\n        the need of replacing those caches with a PreallocationTools.DiffCache or something\n        similar.\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n  </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">AD3</td>\n    <td class=\"tg-0pky\">\n        <b>FunctionWrappers</b>: if you have a deep look into the FrameSystem structure, you'll \n        see that the actual transformations are stored by means of FunctionWrapper. Again,\n        this goes against the AD integration but was choosen for efficiency reasons.\n        In this case there is the need to introduct FunctionWrappersWrappers dependency to\n        solve the issue. \n    </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>","category":"page"},{"location":"todos/","page":"Contributing","title":"Contributing","text":"Write down an email if your are interested in  contributing to one of those, we'll be for welcoming you with some additional guidelines.
