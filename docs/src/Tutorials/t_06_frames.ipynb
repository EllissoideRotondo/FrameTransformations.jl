    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "`Basic` provides the capability to create, expand and efficienty differentiate Frame Systems. \n",
    "A frame system allows you to compute the relative position and orientation of a registered object\n",
    "with respect to any other registered objects at any time. This includes time derivatives of motion\n",
    "up to order 3 (jerk) and well integrated with `ForwardDiff`, allowing to compute partial \n",
    "derivatives of motion with respect to _any_ parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Frames` is a rather generic framework which can be extended and configured by the user. The Frame \n",
    "System, indeed, is the _ultimate goal_ of the `Basic` computational environment. Therefore, \n",
    "the aim of this tutorial is to provide an overview of the core functionalities of a Frame System \n",
    "together with some relevant informations relative to its structure and conceptual modeling, \n",
    "in such a way any user would be capable to understand, use and extend it in the proper way.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The `FrameSystem`\n",
    "\n",
    "The entry-point in the `Frames` computational environment, is the `FrameSystem` object. A \n",
    "`FrameSystem` manages a collection of points and axes in the form of `FramePointNode`s and \n",
    "`FrameAxesNode`s, respectively. These two kind of _nodes_, as you can see from the \n",
    "[Points Graphs Tutorial](@ref tutorial_04_points) and the [Axes Graphs Tutorial](@ref tutorial_05_axes),\n",
    "are organized in a graph form and represent two precise entities:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Axes**: defines an orientation in space. These are related each other by means of a `Rotation` \n",
    "    transformation which relate one axes to a parent axes in a certain time interval.\n",
    "- **Points**: defines a location in space. These are related each other by means of a `Translation`\n",
    "    transformation which relate one point to a parent point in a particular axes in a certain \n",
    "    time interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any node can have several transformations defining their orientation or position with \n",
    "respect to other `FrameAxesNode` or `FramePointNode`, each applicable during a particular \n",
    "time period. Moreover, as you have seen in the dedicated tutorials:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Nodes can be **created** independently of each other (by means of `@axes` or `@point` macros).\n",
    "- They shall be **registered** within the `FrameSystem` to be used, connecting with a parent by\n",
    "    means of a transformation. This step can be usually performed by means of a dedicated method,\n",
    "    i.e. `add_axes_xxxx!` or `add_point_yyyy!`, where `xxxx` and `yyyy` shall be specified \n",
    "    depending on the particular axes or point type.\n",
    "\n",
    "!!! note\n",
    "    Don't confuse the concept of frame of reference and axes! In fact, while in general these\n",
    "    two concept are mixed together, they have a precise meaning within `Basic`:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Axes define coordinate systems, which are a mathematical concept;\n",
    "    - A frame of reference is a physical concept related to the state of motion of something.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In practice, we use a _coordinate system_ to specify a frame of reference because it is \n",
    "    convenient from a computational perspective but to each frame of reference there should \n",
    "    in theory correspond a family of an infinite numbers of coordinate systems comoving \n",
    "    together. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    To clarify more, the velocity of a point with respect to a physical three-dimensional \n",
    "    body is an absolute concept (in Newtonian mechanics) but to express it as a set of 3 \n",
    "    components we need to choose a coordinate system. A natural choice is to use a \n",
    "    coordinate system comoving with that body but it is also possible to use a coordinate \n",
    "    system rotating with respect to that body.\n",
    "\n",
    "    It is normal to express quantities computed in a particular frame of reference in a \n",
    "    different coordinate system. For example, one might solve the motion of spacecraft in \n",
    "    an inertial frame of reference centered on the Earth, but express its velocity coordinates \n",
    "    along axes rotating with the Earth. This is not the same as computing the velocity \n",
    "    of the spacecraft in the Earth rotating system."
