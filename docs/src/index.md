# Welcome to Basic!

Are you looking for basic routines to generate your own _universe_ model? If so,
`Basic` is the best place to start from. The aim of this package is, indeed, to 
give the possibility to the user to create a customised, efficient, flexible 
and extendible multibody model for mission analysis and space mission design 
purposes. In particular:

- Do you need to transform time between time scales and different representations?
- Do you need to read JPL/INPOP ephemeris files?
- Do you need to transform states between different frames?

If the answer to the previous questions is **yes** for your application, then
`Basic` is the best choice to start with.
