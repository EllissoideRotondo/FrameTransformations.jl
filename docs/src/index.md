# Welcome to Basic!

_Base tools for Mission Analysis, Navigation and Guidance._

Are you in search of fundamental routines to develop your own universe model? 
If so, `Basic` is the ideal starting point. The package is designed to provide users with 
the ability to create a customized, efficient, flexible, and extensible model for 
mission analysis and space mission design purposes. 

!!! compat 
    This package is still in development, some features may be modified ðŸ™‚

## Features 

- Convert between different time scales;
- Convert between different time representations;
- Read binary ephemeris files;
- Create a custom reference frame systems with user-defined points and axes.
- Transform states between different frames.  

All of this seamlessly integrated with `ForwardDiff.jl`.

## Mission

The development of this package has been performed with the following design goals in mind:

1. **Efficiency**: being a base package a particular attention has been 
    given to the execution time of the different routines as well as most/all of
    them have been optimised and deeply benchmarked.

2. **Extensibility**: attention has been given also to the definition of the 
    interfaces, which have been kept the most essential possible, in such a way 
    their extension can be performed very easily (also thanks to Julia language itself).

3. **Single Responsability Principle**: The different modules in this package 
    have been organized in such a way they are responsible of bringing only *one* 
    of the desired features. This results in the possibility to extend and maybe, 
    in future, detatch some modules to a different package.

4. **Automatic Differentiation**: seamless integration with `ForwardDiff.jl` is targetted 
    to fully exploit its power in higher-level packages constructed on top of `Basic`.
